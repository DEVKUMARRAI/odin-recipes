    <h3>Hamburger Recipe</h3>
    <h4>Step:1</h4>
    <p>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</p>
    <h4>Step:2</h4>
    <p>Meanwhile, combine ground beef, onion, cheese, egg, onion soup mix, minced garlic, garlic powder, soy sauce,
        Worcestershire sauce, parsley, basil, oregano, rosemary, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Use your hands to
        form the mixture into 4 patties.
    </p>
    <h4>Step:3</h4>
    <p>Cook patties on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 4 to 5
        minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74
        degrees C).</p>
