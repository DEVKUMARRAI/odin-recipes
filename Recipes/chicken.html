    <h3>Italian Chicken Marinade Recipe</h3>
    <h4>Step:1</h4>
    <p>Whisk salad dressing, garlic powder, and salt together in a shallow baking dish; add chicken breasts and turn to
        coat. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator, 4 hours to overnight.</p>
    <h4>Step:2</h4>
    <p>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</p>
    <h4>Step:3</h4>
    <p>Remove chicken from marinade and shake off excess; discard remaining marinade.</p>
    <h4>Step:4</h4>
    <p>Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 7 to 8 minutes on each side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
